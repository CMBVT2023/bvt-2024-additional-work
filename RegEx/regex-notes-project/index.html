            <ul>
                <li>
                    To utilize regex, you need to create a literal expression which is done by entering a pattern you want to search for between two forward slashes<br>
                    Example, /test/ will look for the characters "test" within a string.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By default, an expression will only search for the first occurrence of a pattern within a string, but this can be changed by adding flags<br>
                    There are various flags that can be added after the last /, like g for global which will show all occurrences of the specific pattern.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More complex search patterns can also be created by using special characters, like ".", "^", "$", and more, which allows more dynamic patterns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Within a regex pattern, a "\" can be used to escape any special characters to allow them to be used within a search pattern.
                </li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
