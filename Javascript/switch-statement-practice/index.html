        <h1>Switch Statements Notes:</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A switch statement is useful if you are performing a repeat comparison such as "var ===" and then checking if it equals a specific value.<br>
                A switch allows you to implement certain cases that act as else if statements, and a default case that acts like an else, but in an easier way.
            </li>
            <li>
                Switch statements are first made by calling the function switch and passing in the variable or variables you will be checking as parameters.<br>
                Then within a set of curly braces, write out your separate cases like "case "cat":" and then write the code you want to execute below it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The way switch statements work is that once a case is true, it will execute all code below it, even in other case statements.<br>
                To solve this, utilize break at the end of each case so that the code will jump to the end of the case statement upon reaching a 'break'.
