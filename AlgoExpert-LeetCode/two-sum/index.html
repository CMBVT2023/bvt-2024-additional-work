            <h2>TakeAway:</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, just because something works does not mean it can't become more optimized. Even milliseconds add up and can result in a lot of time being spent when all one has to do is
                spend a bit more time rewriting or finding a better solution. While it may seem like a waste of time, it almost never is since finding a way to save time will add up greatly in the long run.
                There is a point of diminishing return so I shouldn't become too obsessive with it, like my first solution was only around 80ms to execute while this newest one was around 40ms. It is double the 
                time but it still works if needed. However, in the case of my other solutions that used around 250ms of time, that is by far a much greater increase and makes the time spent finding a 
                better solution far more worth it.
