                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, I need to focus more on learning the big O calculations. Look up more videos on it as it is starting to become more useful to know what each refers to. There is a difference between
                nested for loops and having two for loops it seems like, but as I said I need to research this way more to better understand. In terms of the actual problem, I am now realizing how big of a difference there
                is between running multiple for loops versus running nested for loops. These problems are very helpful in highlighting how much of a difference there is with linear and quadratic time complexity equations.
                Knowing this has changed my approach going forward since I am now hesitant to use nested for loops unless necessary. Also, it has changed my view of running multiple for loops separately as I thought that
                if nested for loops are too inefficient, then so are multiple for loops in general, I now realize that I am wrong. Still, problems like these have been very helpful in shifting my focus from getting
                things to simply work, to instead try and make things work in a optimal way and to treat it like every algorithm I create would be used in the real world, making it useful to find ways to make it quicker or 
                use less memory.
