                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, I need to not jump ahead and to ensure that I understand what is being asked to program or needs to be programmed.
                Initially, I created an algorithm for selection sort which is far slower, but because the code worked I assumed that I completed the problem.
                Simply because something works in the moment or for a select testcase does not mean it is implemented correctly so I need to ensure that I have done things correctly.
                The best way to do this is to know what is being asked from the beginning and not relying on trying to figure it out after starting.
