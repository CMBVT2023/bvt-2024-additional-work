                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, this was by far the easiest problem of the four I completed for this week; two sum, add binary,
                roman to integer, and this one. I am now realizing how similar some of these problems are and that methods that I
                am learning from completing one are transferable to others. If I ever get stuck or am unsure how to solve something,
                maybe moving on to the next problem will allow me to find a new method or new insight which is likely a better use of time
                then just sitting and looking at the issue like I have been doing.
