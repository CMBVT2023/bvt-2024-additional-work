                &emsp; Biggest Takeaway, using the object helped with decreasing the amount of switch cases necessary. Also, while there may be different ways to accomplish a problem, I found that it
                could have drawbacks or issues of its own. While the switch case did require more memory to run, it decreased the total run time. One the other hand, using a comparing if statement
                decreased the run time but required more time to run. As of now, I remember hearing that the quicker something runs the more memory it takes so I need to take these findings with
                a grain of salt since it could simply be that the method without using a switch statement just happens to be slower, and I especially think this since the method still uses an if
                statement.
