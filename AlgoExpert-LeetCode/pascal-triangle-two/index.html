            <p>
                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, by far, it has to be that I need to think a bit more clearly when copying parts of code from my previous projects or creations. At first, I thought since this used 0-indexing I
                needed to change the way the rowNumber is calculated since my previous pascal triangle wasn't 0-index, but thinking back to it now it was, even though it wasn't specifically stated. Using an array,
                instantly means that the problem is 0-index based and that is something I didn't consider and it caused me to get confused and to waste a ton of time fixing and changing things unnecessarily.
                Also, I found that sometimes simply because another solution worked using a certain technique or solution it do not strictly translate to other problems. In this case, recursion used too much memory
                and this whole problem was based on reducing the amount of memory needed while also increasing the speed of the method, so using a while or for loop in this cases presented a faster and less memory
                intensive solution.
