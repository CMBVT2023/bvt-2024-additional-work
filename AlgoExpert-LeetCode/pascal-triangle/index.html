                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, after learning that you can also use for loops instead of only recursion, I once again have to realize that there are multiple ways to solve problems.
                Simply because other problems are similar to the one I am working on does not mean that they need to be solved in the exact same way. The fact that I didn't even attempt to use loops
                to solve this problem shows me that I was too laser focused on making recursion work when I should be focusing on solving the problem in any way I can regardless of the method used.
                I need to be more open minded and willing to give other methods a try, even if I do solve something, then I should try and see if there is a better or more straight forward method. By far,
                these problems are showing me that there are multiple ways to solve an issue but the most important thing to do is to find a way to initially solve it and try and make it better. Never accept or
                use the first method that works, there is almost always a way to improve things, but still make sure that I don't go beyond the point of diminishing return.
