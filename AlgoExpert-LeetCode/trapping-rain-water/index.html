            <h2>TakeAway:</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, by far, my biggest takeaway is seeing how much I struggled to deal with pointers and my reliance on for loops. While for loops are not inherently bad and even nested for loops have their uses, they are not
                the method I should try and adopt right away without fully understanding what I am trying to accomplish. Also, when it comes to leet code or algorithm questions like this, I need to start looking more into finding the formula or
                thinking about the solution more as my lack of doing so is causing me to try and brute force the solution. In doing it this way, I am creating solutions that don't work once a lot of data is run through them or that take forever.
                If I start to truly try and understand what the issue or problem I am trying to solve needs in order to be satisfied in all cases, then I should be able to start finding patterns or know to search up formulas that can make solving
                the problem far easier and more straight forward.
