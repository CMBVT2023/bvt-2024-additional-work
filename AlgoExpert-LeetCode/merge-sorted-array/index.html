            <h2>TakeAway:</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; Biggest takeaway, by far, the biggest thing I learned was how helpful writing things out and just drawing how the algorithm is supposed to work. I was completely stumped and was stuck on
                a certain part of the problem yet I was able to over come it by drawing what my code should be doing. This helped me fix some bugs and errors I came across and without attempting this 
                I would have still been stuck. Also, once again, I need to start looking at the provided info for the problem because the thing that caused me the most problems and that left me without a solution
                to solve it, was actually avoidable had I realized that both arrays were sorted already, not just the first one. Had I realized that, I would have known that starting from the back of the second
                array would have provided me the largest value in that array without me having to worry or implement a case in which a lower value occurred after a large value.
