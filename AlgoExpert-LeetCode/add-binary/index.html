                &emsp; My biggest takeaway from this is that rather than assuming, I need to 100% confirm it. I just instinctively assumed that the BigInt value was being exceeded but I should have 
                instead looked it up and confirmed it, had I done that I would have discovered that I was in fact within range and could have had the potential to go look elsewhere for the issue. Plus, I just
                assumed that the mdn docs mentioning that parseInt did not work on BigInt, then there was no other method for specifying a radix. While I am disappointed that I gave up too quickly and switched to
                a method that I knew would be more complicated, I am glad that I went back and saw how close I actually was. Had I taken a couple of seconds to trouble shoot and confirm things, I would have
                understood the issue and solved it my way initially.
