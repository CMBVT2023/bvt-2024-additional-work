            <p>
                &emsp; My biggest takeaway has to be that, even if the code it self has more lines, it means nothing. At first, I thought my nested for loops might actually be viable until I further thought
                it out and realized that I was iterating through all elements in the array multiple times. Even though my code was only 5ish long lines, and my final submission was larger line wise, it runs far
                quicker simply because of the methods it utilizes. While I knew that the amount of lines in the code doesn't equate to speed, it is always good to confirm it and see the difference in a real
                scenario. Also, I learned that the ternary operator is very useful and that it is not always better than an if statement. While I initially used all ternary operators in my first iteration,
                switching to a if statement for the first check made the code more efficient. However, trying to nest an if statement within it actually made it less efficient, so like most things, when using
                a ternary operator in place of a if statement depends. In this case, since the first check would be difficult to implement with a ternary operator, it made more sense to use the if statement. 
                In the end, it is better to be open to use what is best in the situation and not be tied down or strictly use only one method, like using only for loops instead of while loops.
